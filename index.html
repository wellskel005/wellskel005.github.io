    <p>Hi! My name is Kelsey Wells. My major is Software Engineering. I would like to be a web developer.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy baking, crocheting, and hanging out with my friends. I have a boyfriend. I hope to get a better understanding of the work that goes into making and maintaining of websites.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church my whole life. I'd say my favorite verse is Mosiah 2:41.</p>
